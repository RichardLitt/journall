  -p, --program  The program to open with
  -e, --editor   Open using $EDITOR
  --path         The path to the folder (Can be specified with $JOURNALL)

Examples

  Log entered. Opening page.
  # Will open a document with the day's date
```

Journall needs to have a path defined, either as a parameter or using `JOURNALL` in your environment.

It won't make a new file if today's date is already taken. It also adds in the date as a header, and can add a secondary header with the first argument (or the `--title` arg).

The idea is that typing `journall` automatically constructs the file for you, so you don't have to build one yourself, and so you always have a Markdown file you can write anything in that is persistently saved so you don't end up with hundreds of random files in a folder called 'journal'.

You can set the editor using the `--program` flag, which will override your env var, `JOURNALL_PROGRAM`. I suggest [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com/mac/), the best Markdown editor I've found for OS X. You can also use your native editor by using the `--editor` flag.

From then on, simply type `$ journall` and today's date should open.

### Environmental variables

* `JOURNALL`: The directory where files should be stored.  
* `JOURNALL_PROGRAM`: The name of the program which will be opened in the shell and used to edit the file.  

## Alfred

If you're using an [Alfred 2](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow with this, note that Alfred doesn't source your `.bash_profile`. To get around this, use a workflow with the following bash script, where the `journall` path is whatever `which journall` and `which node` spits out:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/node /Users/richard/.nvm/versions/node/v7.5.0/bin/journall {query} --path='/Users/richard/src/journal/' -p 'iA Writer'
```
